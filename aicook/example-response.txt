<p><h3 class="recipe-title"><strong>Recipe Name:</strong> Creamy Tomato and Basil Pasta with Burrata</h3></p>

<p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 15 minutes</p>

<p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 20 minutes</p>

<p><strong>Servings:</strong> 4</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>• 1 pound pasta (penne, rigatoni, or your favorite shape)</p>
<p>• 2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p>• 3 cloves garlic, minced</p>
<p>• 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</p>
<p>• 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</p>
<p>• 1 teaspoon dried oregano</p>
<p>• 1/2 teaspoon dried basil</p>
<p>• 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</p>
<p>• Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
<p>• 1/2 cup heavy cream</p>
<p>• 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</p>
<p>• 8 ounces fresh burrata cheese, drained</p>
<p>• 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped</p>


<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>1. <strong>Cook the pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Sauté the garlic:</strong> While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Simmer the sauce:</strong> Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Add cream and cheese:</strong> Stir in the heavy cream and Parmesan cheese. Reduce heat to low and simmer for another 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to meld the flavors.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Combine pasta and sauce:</strong> Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss to coat evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Serve:</strong> Divide the pasta among four bowls. Top each serving with a generous dollop of burrata cheese and sprinkle with fresh basil leaves. Serve immediately.</p>


<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<p>• For a richer flavor, use high-quality canned tomatoes. San Marzano tomatoes are a great choice.</p>
<p>• If you don't have fresh burrata, you can substitute with fresh mozzarella.</p>
<p>• Feel free to adjust the amount of red pepper flakes to your liking.</p>
<p>• A sprinkle of extra Parmesan cheese on top adds a nice touch.</p>
<p>• For a vegetarian option, omit the burrata and add a handful of roasted vegetables such as zucchini or bell peppers to the sauce.</p>
<p>• To make this a complete meal, serve with a side salad of mixed greens and a crusty Italian bread.</p>
